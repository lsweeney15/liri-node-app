# Homework Assignment #9:
### liri-node-app

This repository is for homework assignment #9 for University of Miami Coding Bootcamp. 

This game was built using the following: JavaScript, JSON and node.js and was made functional by calling upon the Twitter API, the Spotify API and the OMDB API.

## It's hosted online here: https://lsweeney15.github.io/liri-node-app/

## How it Works:
1. LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

2. Using node.js, we are able to retrieve movie information, random information, song information and up to 20 previous tweets.
